# Adjust UI

For test task: https://github.com/spaceship-forks/atlas-ds-challenge

## Notes

- Colors in spec are not enough for dark mode. I've used colors from image.
- It's out of spec requirments but in real UI i'd preffer to support control element with key.
- For dark mode I've used prop but for full design system we can use something else.
- If text longer then field we cut it. Otherwise we keep sizes. Is it correct?
- Element styles not extendable.
- I'd tryed to make element close to design but we have to mant magic numbers in css. Looks like we have a size system in design but no in code. It might cause some problems in future. I'd discuss it with designer.
